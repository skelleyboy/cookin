### Ingredients:

* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 (12.8-ounce) package smoked andouille sausage, thinly sliced
* 1 medium sweet onion, diced
* 1 green bell pepper, diced
* 2 celery ribs, diced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning, salt-free
* 3 (15-ounce) cans red beans, drained and rinsed
* 3 cups chicken stock
* 1 teaspoon hot sauce
* 1 bay leaf
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

### Directions:

1. Heat vegetable oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Working in batches, add sausage, and cook, stirring frequently, until sausage is lightly browned, about 3-4 minutes; set aside.
2. Add onion, bell pepper and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes.
3. Stir in tomato paste, garlic and Cajun seasoning until fragrant, about 1 minute.
4. Stir in red beans, chicken stock, hot sauce, bay leaf and sausage; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Uncover; continue to simmer until reduced, an additional 15 minutes.
5. Using a wooden spoon, mash beans until slightly thickened, if desired; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
6. Serve immediately, topped with rice and garnished with parsley, if desired.
