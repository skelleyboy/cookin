# Kofta Balls for Pasta

## Tools

* Grater
* Big bowl
* Oven 400 degrees
* Baking dish
* spatula

## Ingredients

* 2 cups cauliflower (grated)
* 2 cups cabbage (grated)
* 1 1⁄2 cups garbanzo bean flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon hing
* 1 teaspoon garam masala powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon coriander powder
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 1 teaspoon cayenne
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 (25 1/2 ounce) jar pasta sauce

## Directions

 1. Preheat your oven to 400'F.
 2. Coat the bottom of a 9x13 inch oven proof dish or pan with the 2 tablespoons of olive oil so all of it is well covered. If you want to use more then do, these balls will stick to the bottom.
 3. Grate the cauliflower and cabbage.
 4. Put all the other ingredients except the olive oil in a large bowl and add the grated cauliflower and cabbage. Mix until well combined.
 5. Let the mixture sit for about 20-30 minutes so the moisture from the veggies is absorbed by the flour, this will ensure that the mixture will stick together and you can roll it into balls.
 6. Roll into 1 inch balls. I found squeezing them back and forth in my hands worked well.
 7. Place the Kofta balls in the oiled casserole dish.
 8. Drizzle a little more olive oil over each Kofta ball.
 9. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes. The Kofta should be a nice golden color when you remove them.
10. Let them cool for a few minutes. If they stick gently slide a spatula under each ball to remove.
11. Put the Kofta balls in another dish.
12. Spread 1/2 of the jar of pasta sauce in the bottom of the casserole dish. Place the Kofta balls on the sauce.
13. Pour the rest of the sauce on top. I added a little water to the jar to get the rest of the sauce out. Let them sit for about one hour. The Kofta balls will absorb the sauce very well.
